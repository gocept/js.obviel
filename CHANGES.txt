1.0b3-3-IE8-gocept (2013-06-11)
===============================

- Sometimes `hasAttribute` is not defined on dom nodes in IE so we replace
  it here with `getAttribute`.


1.0b3-2-gocept (2013-03-22)
===========================

- Made obviel-template.js compatible with IE 8.

- I have decided to mark elements with a data-special-attr="true" attribute
  rather than setting a class, because it was the most obvious way. Maybe
  someone with deeper insight can fix this issue by reordering actions
  taking place (expanding dynamic class attribute vs. data-id/-src).


1.0b3 (2012-12-17)
==================

- Packaged Obviel 1.0b3

0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
===================

- Fix translation domain.

- My mistake, 0.11-1 did work. Ignore any previous evidence you ever saw of 0.11.1
  before now.

0.11-1 (2012-01-13)
===================

- Something in distutils/setuptools/distribute doesn't like the
  'resources' directory being symlinked, it just doesn't see it. As a
  result this never was in the 0.11 release. Try again hacking a real
  resources directory into existence temporarily for this release.

0.11 (2012-01-13)
=================

- Initial release.
